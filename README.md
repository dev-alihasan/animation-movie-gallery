# Movie Gallery

This project is a simple movie gallery webpage. It displays a list of movies with their respective descriptions and images.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure consists of a main section with a header and a section for the movie list. Each movie is represented by a list item in an unordered list. Each list item contains an article for the movie's description and a div for the movie's image.

## CSS Styling

The CSS styling uses a combination of global styles, element-specific styles, and class-specific styles. It also uses CSS variables for primary color and overlay color. The layout is achieved using CSS Grid and Flexbox. The design also includes animations for the tab content and tab image.

## How to Use

To use this webpage, simply open the HTML file in your web browser. You can click on each movie to read more about it.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements could include adding more movies to the list, improving the responsiveness of the design, and adding more interactive elements.
